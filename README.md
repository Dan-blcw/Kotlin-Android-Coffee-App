# Kotlin Android Coffee App

## This is an experiment

- The purpose of this project is to adapt to the Android environment. When I was a newbie, if you are also new to kotlin, you can refer to it to learn. Like I said, knowledge is something shared, so enjoy it
- It means there are some features i haven't added here, but i think it is enough for 1 training session
## Prerequisites
- Kotlin
- Gradle
- Android studio
